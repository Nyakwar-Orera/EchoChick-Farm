## Abstract

The Poultry Farm Management System (PFMS) project addresses the prevalent issue of manual record-keeping in poultry farms, which is time-consuming, prone to disorganization, and inefficient. This project was initiated to solve the problems associated with traditional methods of farm management, including the difficulty of retrieving necessary data, a lack of real-time information sharing, and inefficiencies in monitoring farm operations.

The research aimed to develop a comprehensive PFMS for Echo-Chick Farm to streamline operations, automate processes, and improve efficiency and productivity.

### Objectives:
- Establish a decentralized data model tailored for efficient poultry farm management
- Facilitate remote customer orders
- Generate comprehensive records automatically

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL  

### Challenges:
- Module integration difficulties
- User adaptation
- Complex data migration

Despite these, the system was successfully implemented, improving farm operations and information flow.

## Recommendations for Future Work:
- User training
- Regular system upgrades
- Efficient data migration tools
- User feedback integration

## Keywords
Poultry Farm Management System, Information Management, Automation, Farm Operations, Data Migration
